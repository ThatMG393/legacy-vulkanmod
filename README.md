# legacy-vulkanmod
A port of [xCollateral's VulkanMod](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod) to Legacy Fabric 1.8.9

# Why?
To get more experience developing Minecraft mods and also understanding Minecraft, OpenGL, and Vulkan.

And also because why not?

# Credits
 - xCollateral: for the original VulkanMod

# License
Haven't got any time to pick a proper license but it will probably be the same as VulkanMod's license.
