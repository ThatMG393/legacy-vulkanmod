## pausing development for a while

# legacy-vulkanmod
A port of [xCollateral's VulkanMod](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod) to Legacy Fabric 1.8.9

# Why?
To get more experience developing Minecraft mods and also understanding Minecraft, OpenGL, and Vulkan.

And also because why not?

# Credits
 - xCollateral: for the original VulkanMod
 - Zarzelcow: for legacy-lwjgl3
 - Legacy Fabric Team: for the legacy fabric project

# License
Haven't got any time to change to a proper license but it will probably be the same as VulkanMod's license.

# Progress
- [x] Load Vulkan
- [ ] Rewrite the rendering
- [ ] Rewrite chunk builder
- [ ] API
